#ASCII Based Game built in Python
This ascii-based civilization building game is built with only Pillow as a dependency. It is meant to run in the command line, and uses ascii art for all its graphics. It is a work in progress. See Progress section for current status. 
##Dependencies
Pillow: 
pip install Pillow
##Progress
Currently, the graphics are in place for the game. While the game itself has yet to be implemented. The ascii library in particular is very usable and easy to get started with. Features upcomming include civ-game-play, loading saved games, and graphics specific to the civ-game.
