#ASCII Based Game built in Python
This ascii-based civilization building game is built with only Pillow as a dependency. It is meant to run in the command line, and uses ascii art for all its graphics. It is a work in progress. See Progress section for current status. 
##Progress
Currently, the graphics are in place for the game. While the game itself has yet to be implemented. The ascii library in particular is very usable and easy to get started with. Features upcomming include civ-game-play, loading saved games, and graphics specific to the civ-game.
##Getting up and Running
The Game is built with Python3 and uses the Python library Pillow.
`pip install pillow`
###Running the Game 
`python civ-game.py`
Note that the civ-game.py has an optional command-line argument to skip the intro text. This is useful for debugging. Simply add N as an argument as so: `python civ-game.py N`.
